# Projects with JavaScript 🖥️
Hello guys, I am currently learning JavaScript, and I find it really interesting—especially how it makes websites more interactive. 🧩

In this repository, I will share some projects that I am learning from this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EerdGm-ehJQ&t=9678s. <br>

It will take me over 20 hours to complete all of them. It’s quite challenging, but I’ll do my best to learn everything. 📑

I hope that anyone who sees my code can give me valuable advice so that I can improve my coding skills. Thank you so much for following me!  💖

I will be back soon. 🔥🔥🔥
